# Mariner

![OSS Lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/osslifecycle/indeedeng/default-template.svg)


Mariner takes an input list of dependencies, fetches details about them from GitHub, 
and outputs a file containing funding information for each project owner, and a list 
of issues for each project

## Getting Started

Run ```npm ci``` to install the libraries used in the project. Read more about [npm ci here.](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/171556855892/introducing-npm-ci-for-faster-more-reliable)

## How To Contribute

Read the Code of Conduct and Contact the Maintainers before making any changes or a PR. 
If an issue doesnâ€™t already exist that describes the change you want to make, we recommend 
creating one. If an issue does exist, please comment on it saying that you are starting to 
work on it, to avoid duplicating effort.
